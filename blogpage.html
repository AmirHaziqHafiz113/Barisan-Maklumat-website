                         Popcorn is a type of corn kernel that, when people heat it, it pops to become light and fluffy. Popcorn contains plenty of nutrients and vitamins when people make it in the right way.However, many popcorn brands in supermarkets and movie theaters contain lots of added butter, sugar, and salt. These additions can be bad for a person’s health.

                        <p> <p style="color:white">
                        Popcorn is considered a whole grain food, which is composed of a hard endosperm, hull, or shell, containing a starchy interior. When it is heated, the pressure inside the hull increases and eventually a POP occurs, creating popcorn! There are a number of varieties of popcorn, including types that are meant to be cooked in a microwave, as well as other unaltered kernels that can be made in small appliances specifically made for popping corn, such as an air-popper.  </p>
                         </p>

                     <h2> <p style="color:white">Improves Digestion!</p></h2>
                         <p> <p style="color:white">
                         It is important to realize that popcorn is a whole grain, which is a designation for grains that contain the endosperm, germ, and bran. This is similar to whole grain cereals, rice, and bread that also contain all three of these vital parts. Since popcorn is a whole grain, it contains all of the fiber from the bran, not to mention the minerals, B complex vitamins, and vitamin E that is stored there. The high fiber content in popcorn promotes normal bowel movements and prevents constipation. Fiber stimulates the peristaltic motion of the smooth intestinal muscles and induces the secretion of digestive juices, both of which help to keep your entire digestive system healthy.</p>

                     <h3><p style="color:white">Regulates Blood Sugar!</p></h3>
                          <br>
                        <p> <p style="color:white">
                        Fiber also has a great impact on blood sugar in the body. Fiber helps to regulate the release and management of blood sugar and insulin levels better than people with low levels, lowering your chance of developing type 2 diabetes. If you have diabetes, consuming adequate sources of fiber helps to reduce these fluctuations in blood sugar. Therefore, popcorn can be a great snack due to its fiber content. Just keep in mind, portion control is key and avoids adding any high sugar or high-fat toppings to ensure you are consuming a nutritious snack. </p>

                        Popcorn is a low-calorie snack with one cup of air-popped popcorn containing about 30 calories; this is five times fewer calories than one serving of plain potato chips. In addition, the fiber content helps to reduce hunger by slowing the rate of digestion, prolonging satiety. Plain popcorn is also low in saturated fat making it a heart-healthy snack that can fill you up and keep your waistline thin.</p>
